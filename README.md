# Seq.Input.Heartbeat

This is an example of a Seq custom input, implemented using a C# plug-in DLL. The input
is a simple class that periodically emits an event to Seq. The code is intended to provide
a starting point for more interesting input types, like message queues, network protocol
servers, etc.

For some more info, check out the [Seq documentation](https://docs.getseq.net).
